### Objective 
The objective of monitoring temperature and humidity using the DHT11 sensor is to keep track of environmental conditions.Manufacturing Facilities: Implementing humidity and temperature control systems to activate ventilation or air conditioning as needed2. The DHT11 sensor provides accurate temperature readings (0°C to 50°C) and humidity measurements (20% to 80%) with a simple setup.You can connect it to an Arduino and read the data using a few lines of code

### Key Activities
1. Microcontroller ESP32 Development Board
